# Hi, I'm Sicelo Kayisa! üëã

Data enthusiast with a passion for uncovering insights from data and
creating models to help businesses prepare for the future.

## üöÄ About Me

I'm a final year Mathematical Statistics student at the
University of Pretoria.

I'm fascinated by the potential of data science to uncover hidden patterns,
predict trends and solve complex problems. I'm committed to continuous learning,
staying up-to-date with industry trends, and exploring new tools and technologies.

Through my University background I've developed a strong understanding of
statistical modeling,
data analysis and interpretation. I am eager to expand my knowledge and skills
in data analytics, programming, machine learning and business intelligence to drive
business growth and informed decisions. To cement and strengthen my knowledge
in these areas of data science I have also completed some online
courses, scholarships and professional certificates.

While knowledge and skills are important, practical experience is also very
important. To close this gap I have participated in some internships and
hackathons so to have an idea and be exposed to real world
projects. The other important part about this is to also improve skills such as communication,
 team collaboration and meeting deadlines.

## üéØ Projects

* [Churn Predictive Model](https://github.com/SiceloKayisa/My-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Churn%20Prediction%20for%20Financial%20Institution)
    - This project focuses on building a churn prediction model for a financial institution. Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By identifying customers at high risk of churning, institutions can implement targeted retention strategies.
    - This project contains a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook that covers the entire machine learning pipeline, from data acquisition and exploratory data analysis to data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation, strictly using the sklearn library.
 
* [Movie Rental Duration Prediction using Regression Models](https://github.com/SiceloKayisa/My-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Movie%20Rental%20Duration%20Prediction)
   - This project focuses on predicting the duration of movie rentals using various machine learning regression models. By analyzing historical rental data, we aim to build a robust model that can accurately estimate how long a movie will be rented.
     
* [Book Recommendation Engine with KNearestNeighbors](https://github.com/SiceloKayisa/My-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Book%20Recommendation%20with%20KNearestNeighbors/README.md)
   - Utilized NearestNeighbors from sklearn.neighbors was used in this project to develop a model that shows books that are similar to a given book. The Nearest Neighbors algorithm measures the distance to determine the ‚Äúcloseness‚Äù of instances. I created a function named get_recommends that takes a book title (from the dataset) as an argument and returns a list of 5 similar books with their distances from the book argument.

* [Store Sales and Profit Analysis using Python](https://github.com/SiceloKayisa/My-Data-Analytics-Projects/tree/main/Store%20Sales%20And%20Profit%20Analysis%20with%20Python)
  - To analyse the performance of the retail store in terms of its sales and profit.
  - To check which months did the store perform better.
  - Which products seem to significantly contribute to more sales and profit for the store, and with that knowledge what are the recommendations.
  - What can be done to the store to improve its sales and profit?
   
* [Case Study: Customer Churn Analysis for a Telecom Company in Excel](https://github.com/SiceloKayisa/My-Data-Analytics-Projects/tree/main/Analyzing%20Customer%20Churn%20in%20Excel)
  - The goal of this was to discover why customers are churning from the DataBel Telecom Company and recommend strategies that the telecom company can implement in order to reduce churning
  
* [E-Commerce Product Catalog and Inventory System in MySQL](https://github.com/SiceloKayisa/My-Data-Analytics-Projects/tree/main/E-Commerce%20Product%20Catalog%20and%20Inventory%20System)
  - This project involved designing, implementing, and debugging a relational database for a complete e-commerce platform. The core goal was to create a robust and scalable database schema capable of handling product catalogues, customer information, orders, and inventory management within MySQL workbench.

* [Small-Scale ERP System for Manufacturing & Inventory](https://github.com/SiceloKayisa/My-Data-Analytics-Projects/tree/main/Small-Scale%20ERP%20System%20for%20Manufacturing%20%26%20Inventory)
  - This project is a small-scale Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) database system built with MySQL. It models the core operations of a manufacturing business, specifically focusing on the supply chain and production processes. The system manages raw materials, finished products, and production orders, all while maintaining strict data integrity and automating key business logic at the database level. This project is a strong demonstration of foundational database design, data modeling for business applications, and the implementation of advanced SQL features like stored procedures and triggers.
