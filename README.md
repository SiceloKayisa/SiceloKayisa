# Hi, I'm Sicelo Kayisa! üëã

Data enthusiast with a passion for uncovering insights from data and
creating models to help businesses prepare for the future.

## üöÄ About Me

I'm a final year Mathematical Statistics student at the
University of Pretoria.

I'm fascinated by the potential of data science to uncover hidden patterns,
predict trends and solve complex problems. I'm committed to continuous learning,
staying up-to-date with industry trends, and exploring new tools and technologies.

Through my University background I've developed a strong understanding of
statistical modeling,
data analysis and interpretation. I am eager to expand my knowledge and skills
in data analytics, programming, machine learning and business intelligence to drive
business growth and informed decisions. To cement and strengthen my knowledge
in these areas of data science I have also completed some online
courses, scholarships and professional certificates.

While knowledge and skills are important, practical experience is also very
important. To close this gap I have participated in some internships and
hackathons so to have an idea and be exposed to real world
projects. The other important part about this is to also improve skills such as communication,
 team collaboration and meeting deadlines.
